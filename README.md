# Manga Store Landing Page

## Project Overview
This is a responsive landing page for a manga book store. The design is focused on showcasing the products with a clean, minimalist layout and ensuring that the website looks great on all screen sizes.

## Design Choices

1. **Minimalist Layout**:  
   The layout focuses on the manga books, using a neutral background and vibrant accents to highlight the products, ensuring a clean and focused user experience.

2. **Color Scheme**:  
   The color scheme incorporates a deep dark blue-gray for the header and footer, with red accents on buttons to create a professional yet visually engaging atmosphere.

3. **Responsive Design**:  
   Responsive design is achieved using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system, allowing the layout to adjust seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices for a smooth experience.

4. **Product Cards**:  
   The product cards are styled with hover effects, shadows, and rounded corners, making them visually appealing and interactive, with prominent "Shop Now" buttons for easy navigation.

5. **Navbar and Footer**:  
   The navbar and footer provide clear, easy-to-access navigation and contact information, ensuring users can quickly explore and interact with the store on any device.
